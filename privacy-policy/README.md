### Legal Basis
    
 This Privacy Policy is based on the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA, Act 709) of Malaysia, as most of the apps were written there between 2012 and 2018. It also complies with the Australian  Privacy Act 1988.

        -   Personal Health Record - a Portable (Mobile) Personal Health Record based on Continuity of Care Record, ASTM E2369-2005. This  _app_  has been blocked by Google for some incomprehensible reason.

### Effective date and changes to this policy

The Effective Date of this Privacy Policy is set forth at the top of this webpage. Whenever possible, we will provide you with advance written notice of our changes to this Privacy Policy. We will not make retroactive changes that reduce your privacy rights unless we are legally required to do so. Your continued use of the  _apps_  after the Effective Date constitutes your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. The amended Privacy Policy supersedes all previous versions.
    
### The Information

The following information may be entered into one or more of the  _apps_  (cf. Personal Health Record and any derivatives):

-   Name
-   Address
-   Phone Number
-   Personal Description
-   Email Address
-   Password (optional)

### What happens to the information in the  _apps_
    
 Any information which you enter into an  _app_  on a device remains stored only on that device until you remove it or until you manually retrieve the information and manually cause it to be transferred to another device or computer.  

We do not collect any information from any  _app_, and we do not have any facility to do so.  
    
### How information is transmitted if it is transmitted.
    
 Some  _apps_  (cf. Personal Health Record and its derivatives, Exercise Borneo) allow you to retrieve information from the  _app_  and transmit it via SMS and/or WiFi. However, the security of information transmitted through SMS or the internet can never be guaranteed. We are not responsible for any interception or interruption of any communications through the internet or for changes to or losses of data.
    
### Your choices
    
None of the data or information in the  _apps_  is verified for authenticity. You may enter true or false information as you wish. The usefulness of any  _app_  will depend on the accuracy of the information you enter.
    
### Special Provisions [ the  _apps_  are for those of legal age of majority!]
    
The  _apps_  are not intended for use by children.
