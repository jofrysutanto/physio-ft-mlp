CameraHRSpO2.java analysis

Arrays:
	final int arraySize = 4; //Size of arrays used to store red value and system time. 1000?
	private int[] frameRed; // to store red value of each frame, so can find peak
	private long[] frameTime; //to store time of each frame
	private double[] frameHue; // to store hue of each frame
	boolean[] isPeakTime?

STATIC METHOD: decodeYUV420SPtoRedAvg(data, camera...Preview width, camera....Preview height)
	define sample area 50x50 pixels in middle of frame
	sample every 5th row, every 5th column, so should be about 100 pixels
	for each sample pixel
		get YUV, calculate RGB, add R to frameRedSum for intensity check
		from RGB calculate Hue, centered around 0.0 in radians
	find average per pixel - hueCurrent, redCurrent
	- those feed back into PreviewCallback

METHOD: isPeak()
	algorithm for 4 sequential frameRed[] (intensity) levels: up (1->2) - up (2->3) - down (3->4)
	SHOULD USE MOST RECENT 4
	Called only from PreviewCallBack previewCB

	METHOD: resetVals()
	resets parameters, arrays, etc
	
START: onCreate()
	create Dialog guideline() and open it
	create arrays for data (see above)
	create Button saveHR to return to previous app
	create Views for results
	
OBJECT: SurfaceHolder.Callback surfaceCB
	opens camera, sets preview frame size
	
ToggleButton Listener: to start - stop video collection and analysis

OBJECT: PreviewCallback previewCB
	calls decodeYUV420SPtoRedAvg(data, camera...Preview width, camera....Preview height)
		to get a frame and extract red intensity and hueCurrent
	
	from hueCurrent finds hue min max ave SD and puts them into Views (cf onCreate())
	from redCurrent finds red min max ave SD and puts them into Views (cf onCreate())
	from hueAve, SD, Min finds SpO_Current via Lee's regression equation from Tibet trip (altitude)
	from SpO_Current finds SpO min max ave SD and puts them into Views (cf onCreate())
	
	stores frameRedSum (intensity) in last cell of frameRed[] - MOST RECENT FRAME VALUES
	stores frameHueSum ??
	stores currentTimeMillis() in last cell of frameTime[]
	
	checks if isPeak() using last 4 values in frameRed[] (at least 4th peak before can analyze)
		finds HRCurrent
		from HRCurrent finds min max ave SD and puts them into Views (cf onCreate())
	
	at end shifts frameRed[] etc arrays down 1 to allow for next data point at top
	- REPLACE THIS WITH most recent frameRed[] index
